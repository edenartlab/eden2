name: LoRA trainer
description: Finetune a model on top of base Stable Diffusion
tip: This will create a LoRA model from a base Stable Diffusion which captures and integrates the style, human face, or object represented in the training data.

  tip: Almost always, we want to train and SDXL LoRa. Only when we want to make animatediff animations do we need an sd15 lora.
  type: string
  choices: [sdxl, sd15]
  default: sdxl
- name: max_train_steps
  label: Training steps
  description: Maximum number of training steps to loop through your training dataset
  tip: This should be left at the default 300 when SDXL is the base model, unless the user *specifically* instructs you otherwise. If the base model is SD15, then you should *change* this to 800, again unless the user specifically requests something else.

- name: resolution
  label: Resolution
  description: Target resolution which your images will be resized to for training
  tip: Do not change this unless you are specifically instructed to. Highly recommended to train at 512 for optimal speed and at 768 for best quality.

- name: seed
  label: Seed
  description: Set random seed for reproducibility. If blank, will be set randomly.
  tip: You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!
